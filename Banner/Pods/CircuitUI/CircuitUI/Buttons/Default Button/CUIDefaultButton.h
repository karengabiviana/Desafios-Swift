/**
 * Implements the default appearance of CircuitUI buttons and serves as base class for Giga and Kilo buttons.
 * While you can use this class directly, it is recommended to use one of its Giga or Kilo subclasses instead, as they give you greater convenience.
 * A typical use-case for this class would be to e.g. display a different button depending on some kind of context which is not known at compile time.
 *
 * @warning If you use this class directly, you must also use its designated initializer. The CUIButton convenience initializers will not allow you to control the `variant` and `size` properties.
