/**
 * Implements the appearance of CircuitUI buttons to be used exclusively on colored background (e.g. green, yellow, red).
 * In any other cases, please use the `CUIDefaultButton` class and its subclasses (Giga + Kilo buttons), as defined by the CircuitUI design guidelines.
 *
 * While you can use this class directly, it is recommended to use one of its subclasses instead, as they give you greater convenience.
 * A typical use-case for this class would be to e.g. display a different button depending on some kind of context which is not known at compile time.
 *
 * @warning If you use this class directly, you must also use its designated initializer. The CUIButton convenience initializers will not allow you to control the `variant` and `appearance` properties.
